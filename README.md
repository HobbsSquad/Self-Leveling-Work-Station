# Self-Leveling-Work-Station
<i>Work station for woodworking.  Mobile.  Stabile.  Self-Leveling</i>

Physical construction will resemble <a href="http://lumberjocks.com/projects/27579">this</a>.  Here's how we're going to take it to the next level:

The wheels are there so the whole thing can be moved around.  I have a small space to work in, so tools need to be rearranged to create space around them as needed.  Heck, I may even roll something out into the driveway to get some extra elbow-room, or just get it out of the way.

However, once it arrives at it's intended location, it needs to become immobile.  Trying to cut lumber on a saw that moves everytime you push a board through it is not safe or accurate!  Locking casters would be the easy answer.  However, they don't always lock tight enough to resist the kinds of loads a workstation like this will see. And, more importantly, that's boring and low-tech :(

Lot's of tools have "mobile stands" that allow them to be planted on solid support when used, then levered up onto their wheels when they need to move.  Something like this would be slightly less boring, but still not very 21st century in terms of tech level.

So, what we're shooting for, is electrically or pneumatically actuated pistons that will raise the workstation up so that the wheels are no longer in contact with the ground, and the workstation is on stable, non-moving footing.  One at each corner of the workstation should do the trick.

It would be easy enough to simply raise the workstation an inch or so at each corner and call it good. However, I can't guarantee that the workstation will be parked on perfectly level ground.

So, to be fully functional, high-tech, and utilize SBC technology, it will be self-leveling in the manner of many large RV's.

We envision one or two 2-axis accelerometers, a handful of Arduinos, and a Raspberry Pi mastermind behind it all.
